# Women in tech (WIT)
A web application developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase's realtime database, firestore, Google translate element, to deliver a user friendly platform for older women. The entire WIT application consists of three submodules: Chatbot, Recommender, and Forum.

Additionally, the system contains the admin dashboard which is only accessible to admin users of the application.

## Chatbot

Once a new user is created, they have to go through the chatbot. This submodule attempts to gather some basic data on the user to ensure that the recommender submodule can later use this data for video recommendations.

## Recommender

Recommends videos for users to watch based on their described interests in the chatbot section, and their watch-time and likes of the other recommended videos in the recommender submodule.

## Forum

Provides a submodule for users to share their thoughts/interests with other users.

## Admin Dashboard

Allows admin users to view statistics of the three submodules. (eg: likes/dislikes of each post in the forum section)
